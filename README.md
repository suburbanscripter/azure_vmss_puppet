# azure_vmss_puppet
Create an Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set which connects to a Puppet server

Forgive the sloppy setup here.
1. The template has some hard coded items.  They need to be setup as parameters/variables etc:
-- subscription ID
-- resource group
-- vnet
-- subnet

2. the script in the folder should be referred to in Github (I had trouble with getting it to work) or in a public storage container (I will say be very careful here!!! don't put anything you care about in a public container)
